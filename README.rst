Usage
-----

Voice transports may receive additional hints for how to handle outbound
messages the ``voice`` section of ``helper_metadata``. The ``voice`` section
may contain the following keys:

:``speech_url``:
    The URL where the voice file to be played can be found. If this field is
    absent or ``None``, a text-to-speech engine will be used to generate a
    suitable sound from the message ``content``, otherwise this voice file
    will be played.

    This can either be a string containing the URL, or a list of strings
    containing URLs to sound files that should be joined to form the message.
:``wait_for``:
    Gather response characters until the given DTMF character is encountered.
    Commonly either ``#`` or ``*``. If absent or ``None``, an inbound message
    is sent as soon as a single DTMF character arrives.
:``barge_in``:
    A boolean value that if ``True``, stops the playback of the message when
    a DTMF character arrives. This allows the response to the input to be
    played immediately, rather than waiting for the first message to finish
    playing before hearing the response message.
:``tries``:
   If ``barge_in`` is ``True``, this will set the amount of times a message is
   played if no input is received. Defaults to ``1``.
:``time_gap``:
   If ``barge_in`` is ``True`` and ``tries`` is greater than ``1``, this
   specifies the time gap (in ms) that is given before repeating the message,
   if no DTMF characters are received. Defaults to ``3000``.
